# 🧱 Brick Breaker Game - Java AWT

This is a **single-player Brick Breaker game** developed in **Java**, featuring a fully interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Java AWT**. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts in 2D game development, GUI design, and event handling.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the bricks on the screen. The game ends when:

- All bricks are destroyed (win)
- The ball falls below the paddle (game over)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java SE**
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** – for GUI components and rendering
- **Java Event Handling** – for keyboard input and interaction

## 🎯 Features

- Interactive GUI window with real-time game rendering  
- Paddle movement via keyboard (left/right arrows)  
- Collision detection between ball, paddle, and bricks  
- Score tracking  
- Win/Lose game state detection  
- Simple animation loop using `Timer`
